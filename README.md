# Motor-Speed-Control
a small project to control the speed of a DC motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) mode in Timers, and a potentiometer which acts like an input sensor to ADC which controls the duty cycle of the PWM signal and its result is displayed on LCD, in addition to a push button switching the direction of rotation of the DC motor when pressed.
